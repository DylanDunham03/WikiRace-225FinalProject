# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    We will meet twice a week, @Sunday 2 PM - 5 PM, @Thursday 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM. 

    We will book a room to meet in-person at Grainger most of the time, or Discord otherwise.
    
    One randomly assigned person will be required to take notes for each meeting.

2. **Assistance** 

    The team will remain in contact offline outside of meetings, on our own discord group chat.
    Teammates are expected to check the discord group chat daily, and are expected to respond within 24-hours.

3. **Respect** 

    During each meeting, members are required to speak. At the end of the meeting, all group members will need to reciprocate what their immediate tasks are for the upcoming deadlines to make sure that they participated and know what to do for the upcoming deadline.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    In general, a similar workload will be handed to each group member. However, in the case that a person has a higher workload that week, their tasks will be extended/lightened in the following week. We will split up tasks to increase our throughput, having each member work on seperate tasks, most of the time.
    
    We plan to address unexpected complications ny first letting the member who has the problem solve them on their own first, and if it is not possible, we'll then discuss it together in the next meeting, or on Discord if it is urgent.

5. **Time Commitment** 

    Group memebers are expected to be able to dedicate 4-5 hours per week. Given the event of a time conflict, that results in a missed meeting, that person is expected to (1) update the team on discord, (2) read the meeting notes. If they are unable to do their tasks for that week, they should try to complete their tasks asap, when they have the chance. If there are unexpected work, we'll distribute it equally among the group members.
 
6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    When there is a disagremment, group members are expected to act respectfully and logically. If a group member does not accomplish their tasks, they are still expected to keep up to the best of their abilites. If a group member is habitually late, then after multiple warnings, we will contact course staff.
